## SwissBorg Web Tech Challenge

# Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

The task was to display two tables using data coming from the mock HTTP API.

# Tools used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - It's a React framework with some optimizations. Like file system base routing. I used it in my current company.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. Not an expert in Typescript but I have good knowledge of types languages so It's wasn't too complicated too use.
- [AntDesign UI](https://ant.design/) - React UI library. I used it in my current company.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. I used it in my current company.
- [Dayjs](https://day.js.org/) - Fast 2kB alternative to Moment.js with the same modern API. I used it in my current company.

Added some code too fetch data at specific interval to observe both table values changing. Not sure If I had to do that...
